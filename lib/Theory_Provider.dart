/// State Management : Provider
/// In Flutter, "Provider" refers to a state management solution that helps manage the
// state of your application and propagate changes to widgets efficiently. It's a popular
// package in the Flutter ecosystem that simplifies state management.

/// The Provider package offers a way to manage state and make it accessible to
// multiple widgets in your Flutter application. It follows the "provider" design pattern,
// where components (providers) provide data or services to other parts of the
// application.

/// Here are some key features and concepts related to Provider in Flutter:

/// Provider Class: The Provider class is used to expose objects to other parts of
// the application. It can hold state, data, or services and notify listeners when
// the state changes.

/// ChangeNotifier Class: A special type of Provider that implements the
// ChangeNotifier class. It allows you to create objects that hold mutable state
// and notify listeners when the state changes. Widgets can listen to changes in
// a ChangeNotifier object and rebuild when notified.

/// Providers Hierarchy: Providers can be nested within each other to create a
// hierarchy of dependencies. This allows you to organize your application's
// state and make it accessible to different parts of the widget tree.

/// Provider.of() Method: Used to access the data provided by a Provider.
// Widgets can call Provider.of<T>(context) to obtain an instance of a
// specific type T provided by a Provider. This method rebuilds the widget
// whenever the provided value changes.

/// Consumer Widget: A widget provided by the Provider package that listens to
// changes in a ChangeNotifier or other providers and rebuilds its child widget
// in response to changes.

/// Selector Widget: Similar to Consumer, but allows more fine-grained control
// over which parts of the provided data trigger a rebuild.

/// Overall, Provider is a flexible and efficient solution for state management in Flutter
// applications. It promotes good separation of concerns and helps create
// maintainable and scalable Flutter apps.
