/// What is the use of SharedPreferences in Flutter?
// SharedPreferences in Flutter are kept in XML format. It is also compatible with iOS
// and Android. Assume you want to store a small value (likely a flag) that you want to
// be able to access later when a user opens the application.

/// SharedPreferences is a simple key-value pair storage mechanism in Flutter,
// commonly used for persisting small amounts of data in a Flutter application. It's
// particularly useful for storing settings, user preferences, or any other small pieces of
// data that need to be persisted across app sessions.

/// Here are some key points about SharedPreferences in Flutter:
/// ● Storage: SharedPreferences stores data in key-value pairs. Each pair consists
// of a unique key and the corresponding value.

/// ● Data Persistence: Data stored using SharedPreferences persists even if the
// application is closed or the device is restarted. It provides a way to store
// persistent data without using a database.
/// ● Scope: SharedPreferences is scoped to the application. This means that the
// stored data is accessible only within the context of the application where it
// was saved.
/// ● Data Types: SharedPreferences supports storing primitive data types such as
// integers, booleans, strings, and floats.
/// ● Asynchronous: Operations like reading from and writing to
// SharedPreferences are asynchronous, which means they do not block the
// main thread and are non-blocking.
/// ● Platform-specific Implementation: Under the hood, SharedPreferences
// utilises platform-specific implementations (e.g., SharedPreferences on
// Android, UserDefaults on iOS) to store and retrieve data.
/// ● Lightweight: SharedPreferences is lightweight and suitable for storing small
// amounts of data. It's not designed for storing large datasets.
/// ● Usage: Common use cases include storing user preferences, app settings,
// authentication tokens, or any other lightweight application state that needs to
// be persisted.

/// What are the advantages of SharedPreferences in Android?
// Here are some advantages of using shared preferences for data storage in
// Android applications:
/// ● Easy to Use. Shared preferences are easy to use and require minimal setup.
/// ● Lightweight. Shared preferences are lightweight and don't require any
// additional dependencies or libraries.
/// ● Persistence
/// ● Security.
/// How much data can I store in SharedPreferences?
// SharedPreferences are not intended to store a lot of data, there is no limit per se
// (since it is an xml file), but for larger sets of data, I would suggest using Room (or
// SQLite for the older projects).
